title: Slash Command Migration
description: Migrating to slash commands.
---

Hi! Here's what's happening:

1. Text commands are being fully removed :(
2. Slash commands will be the only way to interact with sushii

## Timeline

**Week 1:**
You will still be able to use text commands, but will be alerted that they will
be removed soon.

**Week 2:**
Text commands will only respond with a message that they are deprecated.

**Week 3:**
Text commands will be fully removed.

## Why?

For better or worse, slash commands are the standard for commands. While there
are trade offs, they provide a better user experience in terms of
discoverability of commands and consistency.

## Why can't we keep both?

While in some cases I actually do prefer text commands, unfortunately it's much
more difficult to maintain both. Will be focusing on making the user experience
of slash commands as good as possible.

Text commands are built into a very old version of sushii and will require
double the work to re-implement and maintain both command versions.

## Need help?
