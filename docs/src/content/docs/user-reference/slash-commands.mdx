title: Slash Command Migration
description: Migrating to slash commands.
---

Hi! Here's what's happening:

1. Text commands are being fully removed :(
2. Slash commands will be the only way to interact with sushii

## Timeline

You will still be able to use text commands, but will be alerted that they will
be removed soon.

**September 20, 2025**: Text commands will be fully removed and will stop
responding. Note that this may not be an exact date, but will be around this time.

:::note[Why?]
For better or worse, slash commands are the standard for commands. While there
are trade offs, they provide a better user experience in terms of
discoverability of commands and consistency.

**Can't we keep both?**  
Unfortunately it's much more difficult to maintain both.

Text commands are part of a very old version of sushii and will require
double the work to re-implement and maintain both command versions.

## What are the new commands?

In general, you can find all the slash commands in the built-in command menu.

Most commands are the same as before, just with a `/` in front of them. For
example:

- `-rep` > `/rep`
- `-fishy` > `/fishy`
- `-rank` > `/rank`
- etc...

Here are some notable larger changes:

- Tags are now split across multiple slash commands:  
  `/t` to get a tag  
  `/tag-add` to add a tag  
  `/tag ...` for additional tag management commands  
  `/tag-admin` for server manager-only tag commands

  More details can be found in the [tags guide](/guides/tags).
