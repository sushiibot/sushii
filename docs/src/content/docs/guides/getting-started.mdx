First, make sure to [add sushii to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=193163942502072320&permissions=268823622&scope=applications.commands%20bot).

Run the `/settings` command to see an interactive menu of settings you can

You can enable or disable features, set up channels for logs, and more.
